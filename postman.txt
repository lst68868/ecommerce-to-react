GET /products/:id: To fetch a specific product, select GET as the HTTP method, input https://ecommerce-to-react.herokuapp.com/products/{productId} in the address bar (replace {productId} with an actual product ID), and hit Send.

{
  "productId": "{productId}",
  "quantity": {quantity}
}

Replace {productId} with an actual product ID and {quantity} with the number of products to add, then hit Send.

GET /cart: To fetch all cart items, select GET as the HTTP method, input https://ecommerce-to-react.herokuapp.com/cart in the address bar and hit Send.

Replace {quantity} with the new quantity, then hit Send.
